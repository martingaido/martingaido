### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I have been playing with computers for more than 30 years, working with GNU/Linux, open source software/hardware, doing software development, web development, cloud computing (AWS/GCP), IoT devices, robotics and recently blockchain development, machine learning, deep learning and automation. I am also classical pianist and composer, entrepreneur, gamer and passionate about VR, neuroscience, biology, physics, astronomy, space exploration, satellites, rockets, rovers and airplanes (on my spare time).

I mostly work with BASH, ZSH, Javascript, JS Frameworks (such as React and Vue), Python, Solidity and C++. My research on AI is related to computer vision and natural language processing (NLP). Drop me a line if you want to build something important for humanity. "Grit" is my favorite word.

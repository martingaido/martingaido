### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a technology professional with over 30 years of experience, specializing in GNU/Linux systems, open-source software and hardware, software development, web technologies, cloud computing, IoT, robotics, blockchain, machine learning, and automation. My technical expertise spans BASH, ZSH, JavaScript (React, Vue), Python, Solidity, and C++, with a focus on artificial intelligence, particularly computer vision and natural language processing (NLP).

As the founder and CTO of a tech company focused on marketing solutions, I currently lead a team of engineers in designing and managing web and mobile applications and infrastructure. My passion for innovation drives me to embrace emerging technologies early and explore their potential to shape the future.

Beyond coding, Iâ€™m fascinated by the philosophy of artificial intelligence and human-machine interaction, reflecting on how technology influences society. I also enjoy classical music (as a former pianist and composer), video games, virtual reality, and topics like neuroscience, astronomy, and space exploration.

Iâ€™m driven to build creative, impactful solutions, constantly exploring how our relationship with technology can redefine humanityâ€™s path forward.

### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

With over three decades of experience in technology, my career encompasses a wide range of specialties, including GNU/Linux operating systems, open-source software and hardware, software development, web development, cloud computing, IoT devices, robotics, and more recently, blockchain development, machine learning, deep learning, and automation. Beyond my deep interest and experience in technology, I am a former classical pianist and composer, an active entrepreneur, video game enthusiast, and passionate about virtual reality, neuroscience, biology, physics, astronomy, space exploration, satellites, rockets, rovers, and airplanes.

My technical focus is on working with BASH, ZSH, JavaScript, and JS frameworks such as React and Vue, Python, Solidity, and C++. My research in artificial intelligence specializes in computer vision and natural language processing (NLP). Additionally, I have delved deeply into language models, being an early adopter of emerging technologies, which reflects my constant quest for innovation and my interest in being at the forefront of technological evolution.

Currently, I serve as the founder & CTO of an online tech company specializing in building marketing tools, where I lead a small team of software engineers in developing and managing web and mobile apps and infrastructure. This role allows me to apply my extensive knowledge and innovative spirit to drive the development of cutting-edge solutions that enhance marketing strategies.

My interest is not limited to technology itself but extends to the philosophy behind artificial intelligence and the interaction between humans and machines. This philosophical fascination leads me to reflect on the impact of technology on society and the human condition, exploring how our interactions with machines shape our behavior and perceptions. I am particularly interested in the synergy between human behavior and technology, and how our relationship with machines can influence the future of humanity and our planet.
